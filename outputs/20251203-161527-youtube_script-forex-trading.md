### **Body – Part 1: The Biggest Myth (0:45‑1:30)**  

**“People keep saying ‘Just pick a currency pair, set a stop‑loss, and boom!’”**  
That’s the dream, but the reality? Forex is all about context – economic data, central‑bank moves, geopolitical vibes. If you ignore those, you’re basically betting on a coin that keeps flipping. The first mistake? Treating the market like a slot machine.  
**Pro tip:** Before any trade, ask yourself: *What’s the story behind this pair?* Look at the latest inflation report, upcoming CPI release, or a central‑bank statement. That’s your narrative.  

### **Body – Part 2: Leverage – Friend or Foe? (1:30‑2:15)**  

“Now, you’ve probably heard about leverage. 50:1? 100:1? It’s like a double‑edged sword.”  
With leverage, one small move can wipe out your account if you’re not careful. The second mistake? Not managing leverage properly.  
**Solution:** Use a maximum of 2:1 for a tight strategy or 5:1 if you’re a seasoned pro. Keep your margin below 20% of your equity. That way, a single bad trade won’t collapse your whole account.  

### **Body – Part 3: The 3‑Step Strategy (2:15‑3:30)**  

1. **Identify the Trend** – Use a 200‑period simple moving average on a 4‑hour chart. If the price is above, you’re in an up‑trend; if below, a down‑trend.  
2. **Find a Pullback** – Wait for a 20‑period RSI to dip below 30 in an up‑trend or above 70 in a down‑trend. That’s your sweet spot to enter.  
3. **Set Clear Risk/Reward** – Aim for a 1:2 reward‑to‑risk ratio. So if you’re risking $100, set your target at $200.  

**“Why this works? Because you’re not chasing random swings; you’re riding the trend and letting the market do the heavy lifting.”**
